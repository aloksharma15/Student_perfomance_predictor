## Features
- Predicts student performance in mathematics based on multiple factors.
- Provides insights into the influence of gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course on student performance.
- User-friendly interface for inputting student information and obtaining predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/skprasad117/Predicting-Student-Performance-Using-Machine-Learning.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Predicting-Student-Performance-Using-Machine-Learning`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. Access the web interface in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`
3. Fill in the student information and submit the form to obtain the predicted math score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training is sourced from Kaggle: "Students Performance in Exams."
It includes student demographics, parental education, lunch type, test preparation course participation, and corresponding math scores.

## Model Training

The predictive model is developed using supervised learning techniques, such as:<br>
âœ” Decision Trees<br>
âœ” Random Forest<br>
âœ” Gradient Boosting (CatBoost, XGBoost, etc.)

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to assess model accuracy and performance.

## Results

The trained model achieved 85% accuracy in predicting student mathematics scores.
Key insights from the analysis:<br>
ðŸ“Œ Parental education has a significant impact on student performance.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Students enrolled in test preparation courses tend to score higher.<br>
ðŸ“Œ Lunch type is correlated with performance, highlighting potential socioeconomic factors.
